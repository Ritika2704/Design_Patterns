//
//ðŸŸ¢ Understanding the Problem: Why Do We Need a Singleton?
//Imagine IRCTC's ticket booking system where:
//
//Thousands of users try to book tickets simultaneously.
//
//A database connection is required for every booking.
//
//If each request creates a new database connection, the system will slow down and crash.
//
//ðŸ’¡ Solution: Use Singleton
//Create only one instance of the connection manager.
//
//All booking requests share the same instance, reducing system load.
//
//Ensure thread safety so that multiple users don't cause data inconsistency.
